### Overview

In this project we will be predicting house prices with Keras regression techniques. We will be using data from a Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

As of now we are almost done with data cleaning and exploration and some creative feature engineering. 

Later on we will explore advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting.
