### Overview

In this project we will be predicting house prices with Keras regression techniques. We will be using data from a Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

As of now we are done with data cleaning and exploration, some feature engineering and encoding with categorical variables. 

Next we will explore advanced regression techniques like lasso, random forest and gradient boosting.
